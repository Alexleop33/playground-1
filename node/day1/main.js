/*
Creating my own magic system using key inputs comnined into words meaning each key would affect
each spell differently.

for example the L key could incease heat
and the H key could conjure a ball of water

if added together you would get steam 

then a plus would mean a continuos cast versus a quick cast

words could be made
for example
 rage{
 r = fire conjuration,
 a = water conjuration,
 g = telekenesis on object,
 e = condense object to 1/10 the original size with 10 times the original pressure
}
 
When combined this would create a spell to fire condensed smoke balls and the to finish it off have
and a.i decide the amount of damage dealt based on previous uses of the different letters seoeratly
in game.

:

create a language that could be carved into objects in order to add function to them

You could do this by creating a function to remove space in a letter form after adjusting it via a code
then you could do the same thing as was done with magic but for objects and how they function in the world
with certain shapes already set based on a few basic "incantations".
