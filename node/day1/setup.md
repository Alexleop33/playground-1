# Things we did to get the env going

```sh
# get us npm (for packages)
npm init -y 

# get nodemon to make our dev life easy
npm i -D nodemon
```


Now you can test code easily:

```sh
# start running my code (using NPX, aka NPM-EXECUTE)
npx nodemon <file>

### NOTE: you're stuck in nodemon until you press CTRL + C

```
