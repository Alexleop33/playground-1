# Learning how to code 101
```
Start by learning how to code adn different functions
```
## Make a list of things
* Using the multiplication sign

    * You can create lists

* using these lists you van share data

    * along with instering information


```bash
draw = function()

text("hello world",5,10)
```

### Solid semi title here
1. this makes a number list
2. and I can just continue
    * and I can add sublines too
    (by adding a space between it will widen the space between lines on a list like this)

    1. adding this is interesting

     2. I can keep going too
3. this makes things interesting

% this does nothing

( openeing parenetheses puts it on the line above) it doesn't actually.

{using these ones it doesn't but still puts in the text}

@ this doesn't do much like this @
- 
- this little line makes a title or underlines things.
    - however it can also be used to make lists
        - it also underlines objects
        
_~~~ this one im not sure ~~~_

**_ this one italisizes? _**
